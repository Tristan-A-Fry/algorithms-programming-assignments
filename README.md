# algorithms-programming-assignments

There were assignments given to me in my Algorthims course in university. 

This will hopefully display some knowledge in programming, more specifically in data structures and algorithms. 

I know these assignments are by no means perfect, and may contain errors, but nontheless I enjoyed these assignments. 

These pdf documents were made using LaTex.
